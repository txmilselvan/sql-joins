# sql-joins
# I created tables to use sql join to know the uses of sql join that were using different ways inner,left,right,full that are sql joins were by using tables.

# Decide why you need a full outer join—e.g., to merge two datasets and retain unmatched rows from both sides.

# Identify the two tables and the specific columns to join on ,Confirm that your joining columns are indexed (e.g., primary keys or foreign keys) to improve performance.

# Create sample tables (e.g., Employees, Departments) with representative rows, including unmatched ones (e.g., employees without departments and vice versa).

# Merge the two queries with UNION (not UNION ALL, to avoid duplicates) to simulate a full outer join.

# If your dataset is large, test performance and consider alternatives (like pre-filtering or early aggregation). 

# Validate your logic with peers—especially that unmatched rows are handled correctly,Agree on standard patterns for reusable, full-outer-join-style queries in your codebase.
